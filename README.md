## Part I. Data Structures and Data Types <a id="1-ds-and-dt"></a>

Data structures in Python are objects or collections of objects that can hold and organize data in various ways. They provide a way to store and manipulate data, and can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple to complex.

Python provides a rich set of built-in data structures, such as `lists`, `tuples`, `dictionaries`, and `sets`. These data structures can be used to hold various types of data, including `numbers`, `strings`, and other objects.

Python also provides more specialized data structures, such as `arrays`, `heaps`, and `queues`, as well as libraries that provide more advanced data structures, such as `pandas` and `numpy`.

Choosing the appropriate data structure for a particular application can have a significant impact on performance, readability, and ease of implementation. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures is an important part of writing efficient and effective Python code.

### 1. Basic Data Types <a id="basic-dt"></a>

#### String <a id="string"></a>

In Python, a `string` is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks (either single or double quotes). `Strings` are one of the built-in data types in Python and are used to represent text data.

Python 3.x uses [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) objects to store textual data as immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Practically speaking, that means a `str` is an immutable array of characters. Oddly enough, it‚Äôs also a recursive data structure ‚Äî each character in a string is itself a `str` object of length 1.


```python
# Concatenating strings
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + " " + name
print("message:", message)

# Assemble the string using the specified separator
joined_string = ' '.join(["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"])
print("joined_string:", joined_string)

# Converting case
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
upper_sentence = sentence.upper()
lower_sentence = sentence.lower()
print("upper_sentence:", upper_sentence)
print("lower_sentence:", lower_sentence)

# Finding substrings
word = "Hello"
index = word.find("l")
substring = word[1:4]
print("index:", index)
print("substring:", substring)

# Replacing substrings
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
new_sentence = sentence.replace("brown", "red")
print("new_sentence:", new_sentence)
```

    message: Hello Alice
    joined_string: The quick brown fox
    upper_sentence: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
    lower_sentence: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    index: 2
    substring: ell
    new_sentence: The quick red fox jumps over the lazy dog


#### Number <a id="number"></a>

In Python, there are three built-in numeric data types: `integers`, `floating-point` numbers, and `complex` numbers.

It is also possible to convert between numeric data types in Python using built-in functions. For example, the `int()` function can be used to convert a floating-point number or a string to an integer, and the `float()` function can be used to convert an integer or a string to a floating-point number.


```python
a = 3.5
b = int(a) # Converting a floating-point number to an integer
print("b:", b)

s = "123"
i = int(s) # Converting a string to an integer
print("i:", i)

c = 5
d = float(c) # Converting an integer to a floating-point number
print("d:", d)

t = "3.14"
f = float(t) # Converting a string to a floating-point number
print("f:", f)
```

    b: 3
    i: 123
    d: 5.0
    f: 3.14


##### Integer <a id="int"></a>

Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They are represented by the `int` class in Python.


```python
a = 5
b = 3

c = a / b
print("c:", c)

# Bitwise operations
d = a & b  # 0b0001
e = a | b  # 0b0111
f = a ^ b  # 0b0110
print("d:", d)
print("e:", e)
print("f:", f)

# Comparisons
print(a > b)
print(a < b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)

# Logical operations
p = True
q = False
r = p and q
s = p or q
t = not p
print("r:", r)
print("s:", s)
print("t:", t)
```

    c: 1.6666666666666667
    d: 1
    e: 7
    f: 6
    True
    False
    False
    True
    r: False
    s: True
    t: False


##### Float <a id="float"></a>

Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers that can also be positive, negative, or zero. They are represented by the `float` class in Python.


```python
import math

x = 3.14
y = -2.5

z = x ** y
print("z:", z)

b = math.sin(x)
c = math.exp(x)
d = math.sqrt(x)
print("b:", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```

    z: 0.05723687045956228
    b: 0.0015926529164868282
    c: 23.103866858722185
    d: 1.772004514666935


##### Complex <a id="complex"></a>

Complex numbers are numbers that have a real and an imaginary component. They are represented by the `complex` class in Python. Complex numbers are created by using the `j` or `J` suffix to indicate the imaginary component.


```python
import cmath

# Comparisons
z1 = 2 + 3j
z2 = 2 + 4j
a = z1 == z2
b = z1 != z2
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)

# Mathematical functions
z3 = -1 + 1j
c = cmath.phase(z3)
d = abs(z3)
e = cmath.sqrt(z3)
f = cmath.exp(z3)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
print("e:", e)
print("f:", f)
```

    a: False
    b: True
    c: 2.356194490192345
    d: 1.4142135623730951
    e: (0.45508986056222733+1.09868411346781j)
    f: (0.19876611034641298+0.3095598756531122j)


#### NoneType <a id="none"></a>

In Python, `None` is a special value that represents the absence of a value or the absence of a meaningful value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or function does not return any useful value.

`None` is a built-in constant in Python, represented by the `NoneType` class. It is typically used to initialize variables or functions that are expected to be assigned a value or return a value later on.


```python
x = None # Initializing a variable with None

def greet(name): # Defining a function that returns None
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    else:
        print("Hello, stranger!")
    return None

greet("Alice")
greet("") 
```

    Hello, Alice!
    Hello, stranger!


### 2. Built-in Data Structures <a id="built-in-ds"></a>

#### List <a id="list"></a>

A `list` is the most versatile and popular data structure in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.  

A `list` is an ordered mutable collection of objects. Important thing about a `list` is that items in a `list` need not be of the same type. The internal structure of a `list` is an `array` (more precisely, a vector) of pointers, i.e. the `list` is a dynamic `array`.


```python
a = [] # Create an empty list

a: list[int] = [10, 20]
b: list[int] = [30, 40]
a.append(50) # Add a value at the end of the list
b.insert(1, 60) # Insert value at specific index
print("List a:", a)
print("List b:", b)

a += b
print(f"Add: {a}")

a.reverse()
b = list(reversed(a))  # reversed() returns an iterator, not a list
print("Reversed a:", a)
print("Reversed b:", b)

b = sorted(a) # Returns a new sorted list
a.sort() # Modifies the original list and returns nothing
print("Sorted a:", a)
print("Sorted b:", b)

s: str = "This is a string"
list_of_chars: list = list(s)
print(list_of_chars)
list_of_words: list = s.split()
print(list_of_words)

i: int = list_of_chars.index("i") # Returns the index of the first occurrence of the item searched for or throws a ValueError exception
print(i)
list_of_chars.remove("i") # Removes the first occurrence of the searched element or throws a ValueError exception
e = list_of_chars.pop(9) # Removes and returns the value located at the index. pop() (with no argument) will remove and return the last item in the list
print(list_of_chars)
print(e)
a.clear() # Clear list
```

    List a: [10, 20, 50]
    List b: [30, 60, 40]
    Add: [10, 20, 50, 30, 60, 40]
    Reversed a: [40, 60, 30, 50, 20, 10]
    Reversed b: [10, 20, 50, 30, 60, 40]
    Sorted a: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    Sorted b: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    ['T', 'h', 'i', 's', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'a', ' ', 's', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']
    ['This', 'is', 'a', 'string']
    2
    ['T', 'h', 's', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'a', ' ', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']
    s


#### Tuple <a id="tuple"></a>

A `tuple` is also a list, only immutable and hashable. A `tuple` containing the same data as a `list` takes less space:


```python
a = [2, 3, "Some", "String", 1.56e-22]
b = (2, 3, "Some", "String", 1.56e-22)

print(f"List: {a.__sizeof__()} bytes")
print(f"Tuple: {b.__sizeof__()} bytes")
```

    List: 88 bytes
    Tuple: 64 bytes


##### Named tuple <a id="namedtuple"></a>

According to the name, `namedtuple` has named fields. It is not a separate data structure, but a factory function that returns a new `tuple` subclass.


```python
from collections import namedtuple

rectangle = namedtuple('rectangle', 'length width')
r = rectangle(length = 1, width = 2)

print("r:", r)
print("r.lengt:", r.length)
print("r.width:", r.width)
print("r._fields:", r._fields)
```

    r: rectangle(length=1, width=2)
    r.lengt: 1
    r.width: 2
    r._fields: ('length', 'width')


#### Dictionary <a id="dict"></a>

_Dictionary_ is the second most commonly used data structure in Python. The `dict` is an implementation of a hash table, so we cannot take a non-hashable object as a key, such as a `list` (this is where `tuple` comes in handy). The key of the dictionary can be any immutable object: number, string, datetime or even function. Such objects have a method `__hash__()`, which uniquely associates the object to a number. With this number the dictionary looks for the value of the key.

`Lists`, `dictionaries` and `sets` (which we will consider below) are mutable and have no hash method; an attempt to substitute them into the dictionary will result in an error.


```python
d = {} # Create an empty dictionary

d: dict[str, str] = {"France": "Croissant", "Mexico": "Taco", "India": "Naan"} # Direct dictionary creation

k = ["France", "Mexico", "India"]
v = ["Croissant", "Taco", "Naan"]
d = dict(zip(k, v))  # create a dictionary from two collections using zip()

k = d.keys() # Key collection. Reflects changes in the main dictionary
v = d.values() # Value collection. Also reflects changes in main dictionary
k_v = d.items() # Key-value tuples, which also reflect changes in the main dictionary

print("d:", d)
print("d.keys():", k)
print("d.values():", v)
print("d.items():", k_v)

print(f"Mapping: {k.mapping['France']}")

d.update({"India": "Samosa"}) # Adding a value. If the key matches, the old value will be overwritten
print(f"Replace item: {d}")

c = d["India"] # Read value
print(f"Read item: {c}")

try:
    v = d.pop("Brazil") # Delete value or raise KeyError exception
except KeyError:
    print("Dictionary key doesn't exist")

# Examples of dict comprehension (more on comprehension below)
b = {k: v for k, v in d.items() if "o" in k}  # Will return a new dictionary, filtered by key value
print("dict comprehension:", b)

c = {k: v for k, v in d.items() if len(v) >= 4} # Returns a new dictionary, filtered by value length
print("dict comprehension:", c)

d.clear() # Clearing dictionary
```

    d: {'France': 'Croissant', 'Mexico': 'Taco', 'India': 'Naan'}
    d.keys(): dict_keys(['France', 'Mexico', 'India'])
    d.values(): dict_values(['Croissant', 'Taco', 'Naan'])
    d.items(): dict_items([('France', 'Croissant'), ('Mexico', 'Taco'), ('India', 'Naan')])
    Mapping: Croissant
    Replace item: {'France': 'Croissant', 'Mexico': 'Taco', 'India': 'Samosa'}
    Read item: Samosa
    Dictionary key doesn't exist
    dict comprehension: {'Mexico': 'Taco'}
    dict comprehension: {'France': 'Croissant', 'Mexico': 'Taco', 'India': 'Samosa'}


##### DefaultDict <a id="defaultdict"></a>

If you try to read from the normal dictionary a value of a key that is not there, a KeyError exception will be thrown (exceptions will be discussed below). `defaultdict` allows you not to write an exception handler, but simply treats reading a non-existent key as a command to write to that key and return the default value; for example, `defaultdict(int)` will return `0`.


```python
from collections import defaultdict

dd = defaultdict(int)
print("dd[10]:", dd[10]) # Print int, the default value: zero will be printed
dd[5] = "five"
print("dd[5]:", dd[5])

dd = {} # "Regular" empty dictionary
# print(dd[10]) # will throw a KeyError exception
```

    dd[10]: 0
    dd[5]: five


##### OrderedDict <a id="ordereddict"></a>

Python includes a specialized `dict` subclass that remembers the insertion order of keys added to it: `OrderedDict`.


```python
from collections import OrderedDict

od = OrderedDict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
print("od:", od)

for k, v in od.items():
    print(k, v)
```

    od: OrderedDict([('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)])
    one 1
    two 2
    three 3


##### Counter <a id="counter"></a>

The `Counter` counts the objects passed to it. Sometimes it is very convenient to just feed some list into the counter and immediately get the data structure with the counted elements.


```python
from collections import Counter

shoes_sizes = ["36", "38", "39", "38", "40", "40", "42"]
c = Counter(shoes_sizes)
print("c:", c)

c["42"] += 1
print(f"After shopping: {c}")
```

    c: Counter({'38': 2, '40': 2, '36': 1, '39': 1, '42': 1})
    After shopping: Counter({'38': 2, '40': 2, '42': 2, '36': 1, '39': 1})


Explaining how `Counter()` works with `defaultdict()`:


```python
from collections import defaultdict

shirts_colors = ["red", "white", "blue", "white", "white", "black", "black"]

d = defaultdict(int)
for shirt in shirts_colors:
    d[shirt] += 1

print("d:", d)
```

    d: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'red': 1, 'white': 3, 'blue': 1, 'black': 2})


#### Set <a id="set"></a>

The third most common Python data structure. `Sets` were formerly somewhat reduced `dictionaries`, but over time their implementations began to diverge. However, a `set` is still a hash table with appropriate performance on different types of operations.


```python
big_cities: set["str"] = {"Paris", "Berlin", "Tokyo"}
european_cities: set["str"] = {"Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"}

big_cities |= {"Barcelona"} # add value (or add())
european_cities |= {"Lisbon", "Rome"} # Add sets (or update())

print("big_cities:", big_cities)
print("european_cities:", european_cities)

union_cities: set["str"] = big_cities | european_cities # Or union()
intersected_cities: set["str"] = big_cities & european_cities # Or intersection()
dif_cities: set["str"] = big_cities - european_cities # Or difference()
symdif_cities: set["str"] = big_cities ^ european_cities # Or symmetric_difference()

issub: bool = big_cities <= union_cities # Or issubset()
issuper: bool = european_cities >= dif_cities # Or issuperset()

print("union_cities:", union_cities)
print("intersected_cities:", intersected_cities)
print("dif_cities:", dif_cities)
print("symdif_cities:", symdif_cities)

print("issub:", issub)
print("issuper:", issuper)

big_cities.add("Moscow")

big_cities.remove("Paris") # Deletes value if present or throws KeyError
big_cities.discard("Berlin") # Deletes value without throwing KeyError
big_cities.pop() # Returns and deletes a random value (order in set undefined) or discards KeyError
big_cities.clear() # Clears the set
```

    big_cities: {'Berlin', 'Barcelona', 'Paris', 'Tokyo'}
    european_cities: {'Berlin', 'Lisbon', 'Paris', 'Madrid', 'Rome'}
    union_cities: {'Madrid', 'Tokyo', 'Berlin', 'Lisbon', 'Paris', 'Rome', 'Barcelona'}
    intersected_cities: {'Berlin', 'Paris'}
    dif_cities: {'Barcelona', 'Tokyo'}
    symdif_cities: {'Lisbon', 'Madrid', 'Tokyo', 'Rome', 'Barcelona'}
    issub: True
    issuper: False


##### Frozen set <a id="frozenset"></a>

`frozenset` is the same set, only immutable and hashable. Reminds of the difference between a `list` and a `tuple`.


```python
a = frozenset({"New-York", "Los Angeles", "Ottawa"})
print("a:", a)
```

    a: frozenset({'New-York', 'Los Angeles', 'Ottawa'})


#### Array <a id="array"></a>

An `array` in Python is not the default data structure of choice and is only used when structure size and processing speed become crucial. But, on the other hand, if you are looking at `NumPy` and `Pandas` (a bit below), arrays are your go to.

An `array` stores variables of a certain type, so unlike a `list`, it doesn't require you to create a new object for each new variable and wins over a `list` in size and access speed. You could say it's a thin wrapper over C arrays.

You should distinguish between an `array` ("simple" array), `bytes` (an immutable array containing only bytes, the legacy str of Python 2), and `bytearray` (a mutable byte array).


```python
from array import array

a1 = array("l", [1, 2, 3, -4])
a2 = array("b", b"1234567890")
b = bytes(a2)

print("a1:", a1)
print("a2[0]:", a2[0])
print("b:", b)

print("a1.index(-4):", a1.index(-4)) # Returns the index of the elements or throws a ValueError
```

    a1: array('l', [1, 2, 3, -4])
    a2[0]: 49
    b: b'1234567890'
    a1.index(-4): 3


##### Bytes <a id="bytes"></a>

[`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects) objects are immutable sequences of single bytes, or integers in the range 0 ‚â§ _x_ ‚â§ 255. Conceptually, `bytes` objects are similar to `str` objects, and you can also think of them as immutable arrays of bytes.


```python
# Creation
b1 = bytes([5, 10, 15, 20]) # Integers must be between 0 and 255
b2 = "The Bytes".encode('utf-8')
b3 = (-4096).to_bytes(4, byteorder='little', signed=True) # byteorder = "big"/"little"/"sys.byteorder", signed = False/True
b4 = bytes.fromhex('DEADBEEF') # Hex values can be separated by spaces for readability
b5 = bytes(range(10,40,3))

print("b1:", b1)
print("b2:", b2)
print("b3:", b3)
print("b4:", b4)
print("b5:", b5)

# Transformation
c: list = list(b"\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06")
s: str = b'The Bytes'.decode("utf-8")
b: int = int.from_bytes(b"\xfc\x00", byteorder='little', signed=False) # byteorder = "big"/"little"/"sys.byteorder", signed = False/True
s2: str = b"\xfc\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01".hex(" ")

print("c:", c)
print("s:", s)
print("b:", b)
print("s2:", s2)

with open("examples/bytes.bin", "wb") as file: # Write byte to file
     file.write(b1)

with open("examples/bytes.bin", "rb") as file: # Read from file
     b6 = file.read()

print("b6:", b6)

```

    b1: b'\x05\n\x0f\x14'
    b2: b'The Bytes'
    b3: b'\x00\xf0\xff\xff'
    b4: b'\xde\xad\xbe\xef'
    b5: b'\n\r\x10\x13\x16\x19\x1c\x1f"%'
    c: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    s: The Bytes
    b: 252
    s2: fc 00 00 00 00 01
    b6: b'\x05\n\x0f\x14'


##### Bytearray <a id="bytearray"></a>

The [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#bytearray) type is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 ‚â§ _x_ ‚â§ 255. The `bytearray` object is closely related to the `bytes` object, with the main difference being that a `bytearray` can be modified freely‚Äîyou can overwrite elements, remove existing elements, or add new ones. The `bytearray` object will grow and shrink accordingly.

A `bytearray` can be converted back into immutable `bytes` objects, but this involves copying the stored data in full‚Äîa slow operation taking _O_(_n_) time:


```python
# Creation
ba1 = bytearray([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Create a bytearray from a list of integers
b2 = "The Bytes".encode('utf-8')
ba2 = bytearray(b2)  # Create a bytearray from a bytes object

print("ba1:", ba1)
print("ba2:", ba2)

# Modification
ba1[0] = 5  # Modify an element in the bytearray
ba2.append(33)  # Append an integer to the bytearray
ba2.extend(b1)  # Extend the bytearray with another bytes object

print("ba1:", ba1)
print("ba2:", ba2)

# Transformation
ba3 = bytearray(b5)  # Create a bytearray from a bytes object (b5)
b7 = bytes(ba3)  # Convert the bytearray back to a bytes object

print("ba3:", ba3)
print("b7:", b7)
```

    ba1: bytearray(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04')
    ba2: bytearray(b'The Bytes')
    ba1: bytearray(b'\x05\x02\x03\x04')
    ba2: bytearray(b'The Bytes!\x05\n\x0f\x14')
    ba3: bytearray(b'\n\r\x10\x13\x16\x19\x1c\x1f"%')
    b7: b'\n\r\x10\x13\x16\x19\x1c\x1f"%'


#### Deque <a id="deque"></a>

The `deque` class implements a double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from either end in _O_(1) time (non-amortized). Because deques support adding and removing elements from either end equally well, they can serve both as `queues` and as `stacks`.

Python‚Äôs `deque` objects are implemented as doubly-linked lists. This gives them excellent and consistent performance for inserting and deleting elements, but poor _O_(_n_) performance for randomly accessing elements in the middle of the stack.


```python
from collections import deque
d = deque([1, 2, 3, 4], maxlen=1000)

d.append(5)  # Add element to the right side of the deque
d.appendleft(0)  # Add element to the left side of the deque by appending elements from iterable

d.extend([6, 7])  # Extend the right side of the deque
d.extendleft([-1, -2])  # Extend the left side of the deque
print("d:", d)

a = d.pop()  # Remove and return an element from the right side of the deque. Can raise an IndexError
b = d.popleft()  # Remove and return an element from the left side of the deque. Can raise an IndexError
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("d:", d)
```

    d: deque([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], maxlen=1000)
    a: 7
    b: -2
    d: deque([-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], maxlen=1000)


#### Queue <a id="queue"></a>

`Queue` implements FIFO with multiple data providers and multiple consumers. It can be particularly useful for multithreading, allowing information to be exchanged correctly between threads. 
There is also `LifoQueueue` to implement LIFO and `PriorityQueueue` to implement priority queue.


```python
from queue import Queue

q = Queue(maxsize=1000)

q.put("eat", block=True, timeout=10)
q.put("sleep") # By default block=True, timeout=None
q.put("code")
q.put_nowait("repeat") # Equivalent to put("repeat", block=False). If a free slot is not immediately available, a queue.Full exception will be thrown
print("q.queue:", q.queue)

a = q.get(block=True, timeout=10) # Remove and return element from FIFO
b = q.get() # By default block=True, timeout=None
c = q.get_nowait() # Equivalent to get(False)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("c:", c)
print("q.queue:", q.queue)
```

    q.queue: deque(['eat', 'sleep', 'code', 'repeat'])
    a: eat
    b: sleep
    c: code
    q.queue: deque(['repeat'])


##### LifoQueue <a id="lifoqueue"></a>

`LifoQueue` stores and retrieves elements in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. This means that the last element added to the queue will be the first one retrieved from it. LifoQueue is also sometimes called a "`stack`" because it behaves like a stack data structure.


```python
from queue import LifoQueue

q = LifoQueue()

q.put(1)  # add an item to the top of the stack
q.put(2)  # add another item to the top of the stack
q.put(3)  # add yet another item to the top of the stack

print(q.get())  # get the last item that was added to the stack (3)
print(q.get())  # get the next-to-last item that was added to the stack (2)
print(q.get())  # get the first item that was added to the stack (1)
```

    3
    2
    1


##### PriorityQueue <a id="priorityqueue"></a>

`PriorityQueue` allows elements to be retrieved in order of priority. When you add an element to a PriorityQueue, you assign it a priority value. The PriorityQueue uses this priority value to determine the order in which elements are retrieved. The element with the highest priority will be the first one retrieved from the queue. PriorityQueue is also sometimes called a "`heap`" because it is implemented using a heap data structure.


```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

q = PriorityQueue()

q.put((3, "High Priority"))  # add an item with priority 3
q.put((1, "Low Priority"))  # add an item with priority 1
q.put((2, "Medium Priority"))  # add an item with priority 2

print(q.get()[1])  # get the item with lowest priority (priority 1)
print(q.get()[1])  # get the next item with the second lowest priority (priority 2)
print(q.get()[1])  # get the item with highest priority (priority 3)
```

    Low Priority
    Medium Priority
    High Priority


#### Heap queue (Heapq) <a id="heap"></a>

In Python, a `heap` is a binary tree data structure that is commonly used to implement a PriorityQueue. A `heap` is a complete binary tree where the parent node is always greater (or less) than its children, and the tree has the minimum or maximum element at the root node.

Python's `heapq` module provides the min heap (the smallest value always lies at the root) functions for working with heaps in a list. The heapq module can be used to create a heap, add elements to it, remove elements from it, and so on. 
If you need a max heap, with the maximum value at the root, you can use the advice from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2501457/what-do-i-use-for-a-max-heap-implementation-in-python).


```python
import heapq

h = [211, 1, 43, 79, 12, 5, -10, 0]
heapq.heapify(h) # Turn the list into a heap
print("h:", h)

heapq.heappush(h, 2) # Add item
heapq.heappush(h, 150)
print("h:", h)

m = heapq.heappop(h) # Retrieve the minimum item
print("h:", h)
print("m:", m)
```

    h: [-10, 0, 5, 1, 12, 211, 43, 79]
    h: [-10, 0, 5, 1, 12, 211, 43, 79, 2, 150]
    h: [0, 1, 5, 2, 12, 211, 43, 79, 150]
    m: -10


### 3. User-defined Data Structures <a id="user-defined-ds"></a>

Data structures that Python has no built-in implementation, but can nevertheless be very useful in a real project.

#### Linked List <a id="linkedlist"></a>

A `linked list` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list)) is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the `head` of the list, and the last node is called the `tail`. Linked lists can be used to implement various data structures, such as stacks and queues.

Python does not have a built-in linked list data structure, but it can be implemented using a class to represent the nodes and their relationships. 

#### Binary Tree <a id="binarytree"></a>

A `binary tree` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)) is a type of tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, known as the `left child` and the `right child`. Each node contains a value, and the left child's value is less than the node's value, while the right child's value is greater than the node's value. Binary trees are often used to implement search and sorting algorithms, such as binary search.

#### B-tree <a id="btree"></a>

A `B-tree` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)) is a type of self-balancing tree data structure that can store large amounts of data on disk or in memory. B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

In a B-tree, each node can contain multiple keys and pointers to child nodes. The number of keys in a node is determined by a parameter called the "order" of the tree. Each node in the tree has at least `ceil(order/2)` keys and at most order keys.

Python does not have a built-in B-tree data structure, but there are third-party libraries that provide implementations of B-trees, such as the `bintrees` module.

#### Red-Black Tree <a id="redblacktree"></a>

A `Red-Black Tree` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)) is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. It is similar to a binary search tree but has additional properties that make it self-balancing, which means that the tree is always balanced, ensuring efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.

The Red-Black Tree is named after the color of its nodes, which can be either `red` or `black`. The nodes are structured in a way that ensures that the tree is always balanced, regardless of the order in which elements are inserted or deleted.

In Python, a Red-Black Tree can be implemented using a class to represent the nodes and their relationships, and by implementing the necessary algorithms for searching, insertion, and deletion.

#### AVL Tree <a id="avltree"></a>

`AVL Tree` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)) can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.

In AVL trees, insertion and deletion operations are slower than in red-black trees. But for lookup-intensive applications, AVL trees are faster than red‚Äìblack trees because they are more strictly balanced.

#### Trie <a id="trie"></a>

A `Trie` ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)) is a tree-like data structure that is used for efficient searching and retrieval of strings. It is also known as a `prefix tree`, because it can be used to efficiently search for all strings that have a given prefix.

A Trie is made up of nodes that represent the characters of the strings being stored. Each node has multiple branches, one for each possible character in the alphabet, and each branch can lead to another node or to a leaf node that represents the end of a string.

The Trie data structure is particularly useful when dealing with large sets of strings, as it allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of strings.

### 4. Other Data Types <a id="other-dt"></a>

#### Enum <a id="enum"></a>

The `enum` module in Python provides a way to define named constants in a program. Enums are a way to represent a set of values as a named collection of symbolic constants. They make it easier to write more readable, self-documenting code and help avoid errors due to typos or invalid values.


```python
from enum import Enum

class Color(Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3

print("Color.RED:", Color.RED)    # Color.RED
print("Color.BLUE:", Color.BLUE)   # Color.BLUE
print("Color.GREEN:", Color.GREEN)  # Color.GREEN

# Iterating over enums
for color in Color:
    print(color)

# Accessing enum members by value
print("Color(1):", Color(1))   # Color.RED
print("Color(2):", Color(2))   # Color.GREEN
print("Color(3):", Color(3))   # Color.BLUE

list_of_colors = list(Color)
color_names    = [e.name for e in Color]
color_values   = [e.value for e in Color]

print("list_of_colors:", list_of_colors)
print("color_names:", color_names)
print("color_values:", color_values)
```

    Color.RED: Color.RED
    Color.BLUE: Color.BLUE
    Color.GREEN: Color.GREEN
    Color.RED
    Color.GREEN
    Color.BLUE
    Color(1): Color.RED
    Color(2): Color.GREEN
    Color(3): Color.BLUE
    list_of_colors: [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.GREEN: 2>, <Color.BLUE: 3>]
    color_names: ['RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE']
    color_values: [1, 2, 3]


#### Range <a id="range"></a>

In Python, `range()` is a built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers. `The range()` function is commonly used for iterating over a sequence of numbers, such as in a for loop.

The `range()` function takes up to three arguments, in the form `range(start, stop, step)`. The `start` argument is the starting number of the sequence (inclusive), the `stop` argument is the ending number of the sequence (exclusive), and the `step` argument is the difference between each number in the sequence.


```python
r1: range = range(11) # Returns a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10
r2: range = range(5, 21) # Returns a sequence of numbers from 5 to 20
r3: range = range(20, 9, -2) # Returns the sequence of numbers from 20 to 10 in steps of 2

print("To exclusive: ", end="")
for i in r1:
  print(f"{i} ", end="")

print("\nFrom inclusive to exclusive: ", end="")
for i in r2:
  print(f"{i} ", end="")

print("\nFrom inclusive to exclusive with step: ", end="")
for i in r3:
  print(f"{i} ", end="")

print(f"\nFrom = {r3.start}")
print(f"To = {r3.stop}")
```

    To exclusive: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
    From inclusive to exclusive: 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
    From inclusive to exclusive with step: 20 18 16 14 12 10 
    From = 20
    To = 9


#### Dataclass <a id="dataclass"></a>

In Python, the `dataclass` decorator is a  shorthand way of creating classes that are primarily used for storing data, and can save time and reduce code duplication by automatically generating common methods such as `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__eq__()`.

Using the `dataclass` decorator, you can define a class with a concise syntax that specifies the fields of the class, their types, and any default values or other attributes. 

There is a more advanced alternative called [attrs](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/).


```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float = 0.0

# With a dataclass, you can create instances of the class using the normal syntax for calling a constructor:
p1 = Point(1.0, 2.0)
p2 = Point(3.0, 4.0, 5.0)

print("p1:", p1.x, p1.y, p1.z)
print("p2:", p2.x, p2.y, p2.z)
```

    p1: 1.0 2.0 0.0
    p2: 3.0 4.0 5.0


The dataclass decorator also generates other useful methods, such as `__repr__()`, which returns a string representation of the object, and `__eq__()`, which tests for equality between two objects of the same class.

Dataclass can be made immutable with the directive `frozen=True`.


```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class User:
    name: str
    account: int
```

#### Struct <a id="struct"></a>

In Python, the `struct` module provides functions for packing and unpacking binary data. These functions allow you to convert data between Python objects and their binary representation, which is useful for working with binary data formats such as network protocols, file formats, and device drivers.

Allows you to turn a Python `int` into, for example, a `short int` or a `long int`.


```python
from struct import pack, unpack, iter_unpack

p = pack('if', 42, 3.14)
print("pack:", p)

u = b'*\x00\x00\x00\xcd\xcc\x0c@'
values = unpack('if', u)
print("unpack:", values)

i = b'*\x00\x00\x00\xcd\xcc\x0c@\xa0\x0f\x00\x00\xcd\xcc\xcc?'
for values in iter_unpack('if', i):
    print("iter_unpack:", values)
```

    pack: b'*\x00\x00\x00\xc3\xf5H@'
    unpack: (42, 2.200000047683716)

#### Datetime <a id="datetime"></a>

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates and times. 

The `datetime` class is the most commonly used class in the `datetime` module and represents a date and time together.

The `datetime` module also provides several other classes for working with dates and times, such as `date`, `time`, and `timedelta`. These classes provide more fine-grained control over individual components of a date or time, such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, or microsecond.

##### Constructors <a id="constructors"></a>

The constructor creates a `datetime` object with the specified year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond. If any of these values are not specified, they default to 0.


```python
from datetime import date, time, datetime, timedelta

d: date = date(year=1987, month=11, day=2)
t: time  = time(hour=12, minute=30, second=0, microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, fold=0)
dt: datetime = datetime(year=1987, month=11, day=2, hour=9, minute=30, second=0)
td: timedelta = timedelta(weeks=1, days=2, hours=12, minutes=13, seconds=14)

print("d:", d)
print("t:", t)
print("dt:", dt)
print("td:", td)
```

    d: 1987-11-02
    t: 12:30:00
    dt: 1987-11-02 09:30:00
    td: 9 days, 12:13:14


##### Now <a id="now"></a>

Get the current date or date/time.


```python
from datetime import date, datetime
import pytz
import time

d: date  = date.today()
dt1: datetime = datetime.today()
dt2: datetime = datetime.utcnow()
dt3: datetime = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('Europe/Budapest'))

t1 = time.time()  # Unix epoch time
t2 = time.ctime()

print("d:", d)
print("dt1:", dt1)
print("dt2:", dt2)
print("dt3:", dt3)
print("t1:", t1)
print("t2:", t2)

```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

          3 import time
          5 d: date  = date.today()


    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'


##### Timezone <a id="timezone"></a>

The `timezone` class is used to represent a time zone and can be used to convert `datetime` objects between different time zones.


```python
import datetime
import pytz

# Create a datetime object representing April 15, 2022 at 3:30 PM in the US/Eastern time zone
eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
dt = datetime.datetime(2022, 4, 15, 15, 30, tzinfo=eastern)
print("dt:", dt)

# Convert the datetime object to the UTC time zone
utc = pytz.utc
dt_utc = dt.astimezone(utc)
print("dt_utc:", dt_utc)
```

    dt: 2022-04-15 15:30:00-04:56
    dt_utc: 2022-04-15 20:26:00+00:00


### 5. General Data Structure Concepts <a id="general-ds-concepts"></a>

#### Mutable/Immutable <a id="mutable-immutable"></a>

In Python, data structures and data types can be classified as either mutable or immutable.

`Immutable` data types are those whose value cannot be changed once they are created. Examples of immutable data types in Python include: 
- Strings;
- Numbers (integers, floats, and complex numbers);
- Tuples;
- Frozen sets.

When an operation is performed on an immutable object, a new object is created in memory, rather than modifying the existing object. This is because the original object cannot be modified due to its immutability.

`Mutable` data types are those whose value can be changed after they are created. Examples of mutable data types in Python include:
- Lists;
- Dictionaries;
- Sets.

When an operation is performed on a mutable object, the object is modified in place, rather than creating a new object in memory. This is because mutable objects can be modified due to their mutability.

For the User-defined Classes it purely depends upon the user to define the characteristics.

#### Hash calculation problem <a id="hashcalc"></a>

Any hash table, including a Python dictionary, must be able to solve the hash calculation problem. For this purpose the **open addressing** or **chaining** techniques are used. Python [uses](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9010222/why-can-a-python-dict-have-multiple-keys-with-the-same-hash) open addressing.

The new dictionary is initialized with 8 empty slots.
The interpreter first tries to add the new entry at an address that depends on the hash of the key.

```python
addr = hash(key) & mask,
```
where
```python
mask = PyDictMINSIZE - 1
```

If this address is busy, the interpreter checks (with `==`) the hash and the key. If both match, then the record already exists. Then it starts probing for free slots, which is done in pseudo-random order (the order depends on the key value). A new record will be added to the first free address.

Reading from the dictionary is done similarly, the interpreter starts searching from `addr` position and follows the same pseudo-random path until it reads the desired record.


## Part II. Data Manipulation and Processing <a id="2-dm-and-processing">

### 1. Basic Data Manipulation <a id="basic-dm"></a>

#### Slice <a id="slice"></a>

In Python, a `slice` is a way to extract a portion of a sequence, such as a `string`, `list`, or `tuple`. 

`Slices` are defined using the colon (:) operator, with the syntax `start:stop:step`. The `start` parameter is the index of the first element to include in the slice, the `stop` parameter is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice, and the `step` parameter is the number of elements to skip between each included element.


```python
# Slicing a string
s = "Hello, world!"

s1 = s[0:5]
s2 = s[7:]
s3 = s[:5]
s4 = s[::2]

print("s1:", s1)
print("s2:", s2)
print("s3:", s3)
print("s4:", s4)

# Slicing a list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

lst1 = lst[1:3]
lst2 = lst[::2]

print("lst1:", lst1)
print("lst2:", lst2)
```

    s1: Hello
    s2: world!
    s3: Hello
    s4: Hlo ol!
    lst1: [2, 3]
    lst2: [1, 3, 5]


The values of `start` and `stop` can be negative, which means that it is counting from the end of the structure. You can also use a negative `step` value.


```python
s = "Hello, world!"

s1 = s[-6:]
s2 = s[:-5]
s3 = s[::-1]

print("s1:", s1)
print("s2:", s2)
print("s3:", s3)
```

    s1: world!
    s2: Hello, w
    s3: !dlrow ,olleH


#### Sorting <a id="sorting"></a>

In Python, sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order. Python provides two built-in functions for sorting: `sort()` and `sorted()`. 

The `sort()` method sorts the list in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. It does not return a new list. The `sorted()` function, on the other hand, returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list unchanged.


```python
# Using sort()
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
lst.sort()
print("lst:", lst)

# Using sorted()
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
new_lst = sorted(lst)
print("new_lst:", new_lst)
print("lst:", lst)
```

    lst: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
    new_lst: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
    lst: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]


Both `sort()` and `sorted()` can take a `reverse` parameter to sort the list in descending order.


```python
# Sorting in descending order
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
lst.sort(reverse=True)
print("lst:", lst)

new_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)
print("new_lst:", new_lst)
```

    lst: [9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]
    new_lst: [9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]


Both `sort()` and `sorted()` can also take a `key` parameter, which is a function that takes an element as input and returns a value to use for sorting.


```python
# Sorting by length of strings
lst = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
lst.sort(key=len)
print("lst:", lst)

new_lst = sorted(lst, key=len, reverse=True)
print("new_lst:", new_lst)
```

    lst: ['date', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'elderberry']
    new_lst: ['elderberry', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'date']


Complex data structures can be sorted by `key=lambda el: el[1]` or even, for example, by `key=lambda el: (el[1], el[0])`.

#### any()/all() <a id="anyall"></a>

`all()` and `any()` are built-in functions that operate on iterable objects, such as lists, tuples, and sets.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are `True`, and `False` otherwise. The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one element in the iterable is `True`, and `False` otherwise.


```python
# Using all()
lst1 = [True, True, True]
lst2 = [True, False, True]
lst3 = [False, False, False]

print("all(lst1):", all(lst1))
print("all(lst2):", all(lst2))
print("all(lst3):", all(lst3))

# Using any()
lst4 = [False, False, True]
lst5 = [False, False, False]

print("any(lst1):", any(lst1))
print("any(lst4):", any(lst4))
print("any(lst5):", any(lst5))
```

    all(lst1): True
    all(lst2): False
    all(lst3): False
    any(lst1): True
    any(lst4): True
    any(lst5): False


`all()` and `any()` can also be used with generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions but do not create a list in memory.


```python
# Using all() with a generator expression
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
al = all(x > 0 for x in lst)
print("al:", al)

# Using any() with a generator expression
lst = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
an = any(x > 0 for x in lst)
print("an:", an)
```

    al: True
    an: True


Note that `all()` and `any()` short-circuit, meaning they stop iterating through the iterable as soon as the result is determined. For example, if `all()` encounters a `False` element, it immediately returns `False` without checking the remaining elements.

#### Basic Math operations <a id="basicmathoperations"></a>

##### sum(), count(), min(), max() <a id="sumcountminmax"></a>

In Python, `sum()`, `count()`, `min()`, and `max()` are built-in functions that operate on iterable objects, such as lists, tuples, and sets.

The `sum()` function returns the sum of all elements in the iterable. It can also take an optional `start` parameter, which is added to the sum of the iterable.


```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
s1 = sum(lst)
print("s1:", s1)

tpl = (1.5, 2.5, 3.5)
s2 = sum(tpl, 1)
print("s2:", s2)
```

    s1: 15
    s2: 8.5


The `count()` function returns the number of times a specified element appears in the iterable.


```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]
c1 = lst.count(2)
print("c1:", c1)

tpl = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana")
c2 = tpl.count("banana")
print("c2:", c2)
```

    c1: 2
    c2: 2


The `min()` function returns the smallest element in the iterable. It can also take multiple arguments, in which case it returns the smallest argument.


```python
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
m1 = min(lst)
print("m1:", m1)

tpl = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
m2 = min(tpl)
print("m2:", m2)

print("m3:", min(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5))
```

    m1: 1
    m2: apple
    m3: 1


The `max()` function returns the largest element in the iterable. It can also take multiple arguments, in which case it returns the largest argument.


```python
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
m1 = max(lst)
print("m1:", m1)

tpl = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
m2 = max(tpl)
print("m2:", m2)

print("m3:", max(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5))
```

    m1: 9
    m2: cherry
    m3: 9


##### Basic math <a id="basicmath"></a>

In Python, basic math operations include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and exponentiation (`**`). These operators work on numeric data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers.


```python
a = 5
b = 3

# Addition
c1 = a + b
print("c1:", c1)

# Subtraction
c2 = a - b
print("c2:", c2)

# Multiplication
c3 = a * b
print("c3:", c3)

# Division
c4 = a / b
print("c4:", c4)

# Exponentiation
c5 = a ** b
print("c5:", c5)
```

    c1: 8
    c2: 2
    c3: 15
    c4: 1.6666666666666667
    c5: 125


Note that division (`/`) always returns a floating-point number, even if both operands are integers. If you want to perform integer division, use the `//` operator instead.


```python
a = 5
b = 3
c = a // b
print("c:", c)
```

    c: 1


##### Bit operations <a id="bitoperations"></a>

Bit operations are used to manipulate individual bits in binary numbers. Bitwise operators work on integers at the binary level, and are used to perform operations such as shifting bits left or right, setting or clearing individual bits, and performing logical operations on bits.

Here are the bitwise operators in Python:

- `&` (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
- `|` (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if one of the bits is 1.
- `^` (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
- `~` (NOT): Inverts all the bits.
- `<<` (left shift): Shifts the bits left by a specified number of positions.
- `>>` (right shift): Shifts the bits right by a specified number of positions.


```python
a = 0b1010
b = 0b1100

# AND
c1 = bin(a & b)
print("c1:", c1)

# OR
c2 = bin(a | b)
print("c2:", c2)

# XOR
c3 = bin(a ^ b)
print("c3:", c3)

# NOT
c4 = bin(~a)
print("c4:", c4)

# Left shift
c5 = bin(a << 2)
print("c5:", c5)

# Right shift
c6 = bin(a >> 2)
print("c6:", c6)
```

    c1: 0b1000
    c2: 0b1110
    c3: 0b110
    c4: -0b1011
    c5: 0b101000
    c6: 0b10


##### Bit count <a id="bitcount"></a>

Bit count refers to the number of set bits (bits with a value of 1) in a binary representation of an integer. One way to count the number of set bits in Python is to use the `bin()` function to convert the integer to a binary string, and then use the `count()` method to count the number of '1' characters in the string.


```python
num = 10
binary = bin(num)[2:]  # remove the '0b' prefix
count = binary.count('1')
print("count:", count)
```

    count: 2


##### Fraction <a id="fraction"></a>

Fractions can be represented using the `fractions` module. The `Fraction` class in this module represents a rational number as a numerator and a denominator. The `Fraction` class can be initialized with a numerator and denominator, or with a string representation of a fraction.


```python
from fractions import Fraction

frac = Fraction(3, 4)
print("frac:", frac)
```

    frac: 3/4


The `Fraction` class also provides various methods for performing arithmetic operations on fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Note that the `Fraction` class automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms, so the fraction `5/4` in the example above is automatically simplified to `1 1/4`.


```python
from fractions import Fraction

frac1 = Fraction(3, 4)
frac2 = Fraction(1, 2)

sum_frac = frac1 + frac2
print("sum_frac:", sum_frac)

diff_frac = frac1 - frac2
print("diff_frac:", diff_frac)

prod_frac = frac1 * frac2
print("prod_frac:", prod_frac)

quot_frac = frac1 / frac2
print("quot_frac:", quot_frac)
```

    sum_frac: 5/4
    diff_frac: 1/4
    prod_frac: 3/8
    quot_frac: 3/2


##### Euclidean distance <a id="euclideandistance"></a>

The Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space can be calculated using the `distance` function from the `scipy.spatial` module.

The `distance` function can also be used to calculate other types of distances, such as Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance, by passing different parameters to the function.


```python
from scipy.spatial import distance

point1 = (1, 2, 3)
point2 = (4, 5, 6)

euclidean_dist = distance.euclidean(point1, point2)
print("euclidean_dist:", euclidean_dist)
```

    euclidean_dist: 5.196152422706632


### 2. String Operations <a id="string-operations"></a>

#### lower(), upper(), capitalize(), title() <a id="loweruppercapitalizetitle"></a>

GitHub Copilot: In Python, strings have several built-in methods for modifying their case and capitalization.

- `lower()`: This method returns a new string with all the characters in lowercase.
- `upper()`: This method returns a new string with all the characters in uppercase.
- `capitalize()`: This method returns a new string with the first character in uppercase and the rest in lowercase.
- `title()`: This method returns a new string with the first character of each word in uppercase and the rest in lowercase.


```python
string = "Hello, World!"

lower_string = string.lower()
print("lower_string:", lower_string)

upper_string = string.upper()
print("upper_string:", upper_string)

string = "hello, world!"

cap_string = string.capitalize()
print("cap_string:", cap_string)

title_string = string.title()
print("title_string:", title_string)
```

    lower_string: hello, world!
    upper_string: HELLO, WORLD!
    cap_string: Hello, world!
    title_string: Hello, World!


#### strip() <a id="strip"></a>

`strip()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) from a string.

The `strip()` method can also be used to remove specific characters from the beginning and end of a string by passing a string argument to the method. This argument specifies the characters to be removed. Note that the order of the characters in the argument does not matter.


```python
string = "   hello, world!   \n"
stripped_string_1 = string.strip()
print("stripped_string_1:", stripped_string_1)

string = "+++hello, world!---"
stripped_string_2 = string.strip('+-')
print("stripped_string_2:", stripped_string_2)
```

    stripped_string_1: hello, world!
    stripped_string_2: hello, world!


#### split() <a id="split"></a>

The `split()` method is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. By default, the delimiter is whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines), but a different delimiter can be specified as an argument to the method. 

The `split()` method can also be used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified maximum number of splits. This is done by passing a second argument to the method, which specifies the maximum number of splits to perform.


```python
string = "hello world!"
split_string_1 = string.split()
print("split_string_1:", split_string_1)

string = "hello,world!"
split_string_2 = string.split(',')
print("split_string_2:", split_string_2)

string = "hello,world,how,are,you?"
split_string_3 = string.split(',', 2)
print("split_string_3:", split_string_3)
```

    split_string_1: ['hello', 'world!']
    split_string_2: ['hello', 'world!']
    split_string_3: ['hello', 'world', 'how,are,you?']


#### ord(), chr() <a id="ordchr"></a>

GitHub Copilot: In Python, the `ord()` and `chr()` functions are used to convert between characters and their corresponding ASCII codes. 

- The `ord()` function takes a single character as an argument and returns its corresponding ASCII code as an integer.
- The `chr()` function takes an integer ASCII code as an argument and returns the corresponding character as a string.

Note that the `ord()` and `chr()` functions only work with ASCII characters and codes. For Unicode characters and codes, the `ord()` and `chr()` functions may not work as expected.


```python
char = 'A'

ascii_code = ord(char)
print("ascii_code:", ascii_code)

char = chr(ascii_code + 1)
print("char:", char)
```

    ascii_code: 65
    char: B


### 3. Regular Expressions <a id="regular-expressions"></a>

#### RegEx <a id="regex"></a>

Regular expressions (often abbreviated as "`RegEx`") are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. This pattern can be used to match strings or parts of strings. Python's `re` module provides functions to work with regular expressions.

1. Basic Patterns:

- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of the string.
- `$`: Matches the end of the string.
- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character or group.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding character or group.
- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding character or group.
- `\d`: Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to [0-9].
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit character.
- `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character or underscore; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].
- `\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character.
- `\s`: Matches any whitespace character.
- `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.

2. Functions in the re module:

- `search()`: Searches for a match to the pattern anywhere in the string. Returns a match object if found, otherwise returns None.
- `findall()`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.
- `finditer()`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.
- `sub()`: Replaces one or many matches with a string.
- `split()`: Splits the source string by the occurrences of the pattern.


```python
import re

# Search for the word "Python" in the given string
result = re.search(r'Python', 'Learning Python is fun!')
if result:
    print(f"Match found at index {result.start()} to {result.end()}.")
else:
    print("Match not found!")

# Extract all email addresses from the given string
text = "Contact us at contact@mywebsite.com or at support@mywebsite.com"
pattern = r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+'
print("findall:", re.findall(pattern, text))

# Find all words that are exactly 3 characters long
text = "The cat and the hat sat on the mat."
pattern = r'\b\w{3}\b'
for match in re.finditer(pattern, text):
    print(f"Found word: {match.group()} at position {match.start()}-{match.end()}.")

# Replace all occurrences of "apple" or "orange" with "fruit"
text = "I have two apples and three oranges."
pattern = r'apple|orange'
print("sub:", re.sub(pattern, 'fruit', text))

# Split a string by any number (e.g., "3a5b2c" -> ['a', 'b', 'c'])
text = "3a5b2c"
pattern = r'\d'
print("split:", re.split(pattern, text))
```

    Match found at index 9 to 15.
    findall: ['contact@mywebsite.com', 'support@mywebsite.com']
    Found word: The at position 0-3.
    Found word: cat at position 4-7.
    Found word: and at position 8-11.
    Found word: the at position 12-15.
    Found word: hat at position 16-19.
    Found word: sat at position 20-23.
    Found word: the at position 27-30.
    Found word: mat at position 31-34.
    sub: I have two fruits and three fruits.
    split: ['', 'a', 'b', 'c']


#### match() <a id="match"></a>

The `match()` function is used to match a regular expression pattern at the beginning of a string. The `match()` function returns a `Match` object if the pattern matches the beginning of the string, or `None` if there is no match.

Note that the `match()` function only matches patterns at the beginning of the string. If you want to match a pattern anywhere in the string, you should use the `search()` function instead.


```python
import re

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
pattern = r"(\w+) (\w+)"

match = re.match(pattern, string)

group = match.group()  # Returns the entire match
print("group:", group)

group_1 = match.group(1)  # Returns the first parenthesized subgroup
print("group(1):", group_1)

groups = match.groups()  # Returns a tuple containing all the subgroups
print("groups:", groups)

start = match.start()  # Returns the start position of the match
print("start:", start)

end = match.end()  # Returns the end position of the match
print("end:", end)

tuple = match.span()  # Returns a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match
print("tuple:", tuple)
```

## Part III. Control Flow and Data Flows <a id="3-cf-and-df">

### 1. Conditional Statements <a id="conditional-statements"></a>

#### if, else, elif <a id="if-else-elif"></a>

In Python, `if`, `else`, and `elif` are used to create conditional statements that allow a program to execute different code depending on whether a condition is true or false. The `elif` is short for "else if". You can have multiple `elif` statements in a conditional statement to check for multiple conditions. The `else` statement is optional and is executed if none of the previous conditions are true.


```python
x = 5

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

    x is less than or equal to 5


#### Nested conditions <a id="nested-conditions"></a>

Nested conditions are conditional statements that are placed inside other conditional statements. Nested conditions allow you to check for multiple conditions and execute different code depending on the outcome of those conditions.

You can have multiple levels of nested conditions to check for multiple conditions and execute different code depending on the outcome of those conditions. However, it's important to keep your code organized and easy to read, so you should avoid nesting too many conditions if possible.


```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("Both x and y are positive.")
    else:
        print("x is positive but y is not.")
else:
    print("x is not positive.")
```

    Both x and y are positive.


### 2. Loops <a id="loops"></a>

#### for loop <a id="for-loop"></a>

The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that can be a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. The `for` loop runs a block of code for each item in the sequence. `for` loops can be used to iterate over any sequence of elements, and can be combined with conditional statements and other control flow statements to create complex programs.


```python
# 1. Iterating through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

print("------")

# 2. Iterating through a string
for char in "apple":
    print(char)

print("------")

# 3. Iterating through a tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
for color in colors:
    print(color)

print("------")

# 4. Iterating through a dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# By keys
for key in person:
    print(key, ":", person[key])

print("------")

# By values
for value in person.values():
    print(value)

print("------")

# By both keys and values
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, ":", value)

print("------")

# 5. Iterating through a set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
for num in unique_numbers:
    print(num)

print("------")
```

    apple
    banana
    cherry
    ------
    a
    p

    city : New York
    ------
    John

    name : John
    age : 30
    city : New York
    ------

    4
    ------


#### range() <a id="range()"></a>

The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. The `range()` function can take one, two, or three parameters. 
- If you pass one parameter to the `range()` function, it will return a sequence of numbers starting at 0 and ending at the number before the parameter.

- If you pass two parameters to the `range()` function, it will return a sequence of numbers starting at the first parameter and ending at the number before the second parameter.

- If you pass three parameters to the `range()` function, it will return a sequence of numbers starting at the first parameter and ending at the number before the second parameter, with each number increasing by the third parameter.


```python
for i in range(5):  # Will iterate over numbers from 0 to 4
    print(i)
    
print("------")

for i in range(1, 5):  # Will iterate over numbers from 1 to 4
    print(i)

print("------")

for i in range(1, 5, 2):  # Will iterate over numbers from 1 to 4 with a step of 2
    print(i)
```

#### while loop <a id="while-loop"></a>

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. The `while` loop is useful when you don't know how many times you need to execute a block of code, or when you need to execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

`while` loops can be used to iterate over any sequence of elements, and can be combined with conditional statements and other control flow statements to create complex programs.

Note that it's important to make sure that the condition in a `while` loop will eventually become false, otherwise the loop will continue to execute indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop. You can use a `break` statement to exit a `while` loop prematurely if necessary.


```python
i = 0

while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4


#### Nested loops <a id="nested-loops"></a>

Nested loops are loops that are placed inside other loops. Nested loops allow you to iterate over multiple sequences of elements at the same time. You can have multiple levels of nested loops to iterate over multiple sequences of elements at the same time. However, it's important to keep your code organized and easy to read, so you should avoid nesting too many loops if possible.


```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
```

    0 0
    0 1
    1 0
    1 1
    2 0
    2 1


### 3. Loop Control Statements <a id="loop-control-statements"></a>

#### break <a id="break"></a>

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. The `break` statement can be used to exit a `for` loop or a `while` loop. The `break` statement is useful when you need to exit a loop based on a certain condition.

When a `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program continues executing from the next statement after the loop.


```python
i = 0

while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        break
print("------")
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ------


#### continue <a id="continue"></a>

The `continue` is a control flow statement that allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. When a `continue` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop skips the remaining statements in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. 

The `continue` statement is useful when you need to skip certain iterations of a loop based on a certain condition.


```python
i = 0

while i < 10:
    i += 1
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

    1
    3
    5
    7
    9


#### pass <a id="pass"></a>

In Python, `pass` is a null statement that does nothing. It is used as a placeholder when you need to include a statement in your code that does nothing, but you don't want to leave an empty block of code. The `pass` statement can be used inside loops, conditional statements, and other control flow statements as a placeholder for code that you haven't written yet.


```python
def my_function():
    pass


for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
```

### 4. Itertools <a id="itertools"></a>

#### Infinite iterators <a id="infinite-iterators"></a>

In Python, iterators that can iterate indefinitely are called `infinite iterators`. The standard library provides a few such iterators, mainly through the itertools module. The most commonly used infinite iterators are:

- `count(start=0, step=1)`: Starts from the start number and keeps on incrementing by the step value indefinitely.

- `cycle(iterable)`: This iterator cycles through an iterable indefinitely.

- `repeat(elem [,times])`: This iterator repeatedly returns the provided element. If the optional times argument is provided, it will repeat for the specified number of times, otherwise, it will repeat indefinitely.

Note: Infinite iterators can lead to infinite loops if not handled properly. Always ensure there's a condition to break out of the loop to prevent unintended infinite execution.


```python
from itertools import count, cycle, repeat

print("count:", end=" ")
for i in count(10, 3):
    if i > 25:
        break
    else:
        print(i, end=", ")

print("\ncycle:", end=" ")
counter = 0
for item in cycle('XYZ'):
    if counter > 7:
        break
    print(item, end=", ")
    counter += 1

print("\nrepeat:", end=" ")
for item in repeat('A', 5):
    print(item, end=", ")
```

    count: 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 
    cycle: X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y, 
    repeat: A, A, A, A, A, 



#### Finite iterators <a id="finite-iterators"></a>

In Python, iterators that can iterate over a finite sequence of elements are called `finite iterators`. The standard library provides a few such iterators, mainly through the itertools module. The most commonly used finite iterators are:

- `accumulate(iterable[, func, *, initial=None])`: Produces accumulated sums, or accumulated results of other binary functions

- `chain(*iterables)`: Used for chaining multiple iterables together.

- `groupby(iterable, key=None)`: Groups consecutive elements of the iterable which have the same key.

- `islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])`: Returns an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable.

- `zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None)`: Iterates over multiple input iterables simultaneously, filling in missing values with a specified fillvalue.

These are just a few of the finite iterators provided by `itertools`. Each of these tools can be incredibly useful in various scenarios, especially when dealing with complex iteration patterns.


```python
from itertools import accumulate, chain, groupby, islice, zip_longest

# Using accumulate()
print("accumulate :", list(accumulate([1, 2, 3, 4])))

# Using chain()
print("chain :", list(chain('ABC', 'DEF')))

# Using groupby()
print("groupby:", end=" ")
for key, group in groupby('AABBCCAA'):
    print(key, list(group))

# Using islice()
print("islice :", list(islice('ABCDEFG', 2, 5)))

# Using zip_longest()
print("zip_longest :", list(zip_longest('AB', '12345', fillvalue='x')))
```

    accumulate : [1, 3, 6, 10]
    chain : ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
    groupby: A ['A', 'A']
    B ['B', 'B']
    C ['C', 'C']
    A ['A', 'A']
    islice : ['C', 'D', 'E']
    zip_longest : [('A', '1'), ('B', '2'), ('x', '3'), ('x', '4'), ('x', '5')]


#### Combinatorics <a id="combinatorics"></a>

The `itertools` module provides functions for working with combinatorics, which is the study of combinations and permutations of elements in a set. These functions can be used to generate all possible combinations or permutations of a set of elements, which can be useful in a variety of applications, such as generating test cases or analyzing data.

Here are some of the combinatoric functions provided by the `itertools` module:

- `product(*iterables, repeat=1)`: This function generates the Cartesian product of the input iterables, which is a sequence of tuples containing one element from each input iterable. The `repeat` argument specifies the number of times to repeat the input iterables.

- `permutations(iterable, r=None)`: This function generates all possible permutations of the elements in `iterable`, with a length of `r` if specified, or the length of `iterable` if not specified.

- `combinations(iterable, r)`: This function generates all possible combinations of the elements in `iterable` of length `r`.

- `combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)`: This function generates all possible combinations of the elements in `iterable` of length `r`, allowing for repeated elements.

Combinatoric functions can be useful when you need to generate all possible combinations or permutations of a set of elements. They can be especially useful when working with large datasets or when you need to perform complex operations on sequences of data.


```python
from itertools import product, combinations, permutations, combinations_with_replacement

list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = [1, 2]

print("product:", list(product(list1, list2)))
print("combinations:", list(combinations(list1, 2)))
print("permutations:", list(permutations(list1, 2)))
print("combinations_with_replacement:", list(combinations_with_replacement(list1, 2)))
```

    product: [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 1), ('c', 2)]
    combinations: [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')]
    permutations: [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'a'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b')]
    combinations_with_replacement: [('a', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'c')]


### 5. enumerate() <a id="enumerate"></a>

The `enumerate()` function is used to add a counter to an iterable object. The `enumerate()` function returns an enumerate object that contains tuples of the index and item in the iterable object.

The `enumerate()` function can be used to iterate over the index and item of an iterable object at the same time.


```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(i, fruit)
```

    0 apple
    1 banana
    2 cherry


### 6. zip() <a id="zip"></a>

`zip()` is a built-in function that takes two or more iterables as arguments and returns an iterator that generates tuples containing the corresponding elements from each iterable. The resulting iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

The `zip()` function can take any number of iterables as arguments, and returns an iterator that generates tuples containing the corresponding elements from each iterable. If the input iterables are of different lengths, the resulting iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

The `zip()` function is useful when you need to combine two or more iterables into a single iterable that contains the corresponding elements from each input iterable. It can be especially useful when working with large datasets or when you need to perform complex operations on sequences of data.


```python
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

print("zip:", list(zip(list1, list2)))
```

    zip: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]


### 7. Context Managers <a id="context-managers"></a>

#### enter/exit <a id="enter-exit"></a>

A context manager in Python is an object designed to set up a resource for a portion of code and then clean up that resource after the code has run. The most common use case is with file handling where you need to open a file, perform operations, and then close it. Context managers make this process cleaner and more readable.

The primary mechanism for using context managers is the with statement. The context manager provides two methods:

1. `__enter__(self)`:
- This method is run when execution flow enters the block of the with statement.
- It returns the resource that needs to be managed, like a file for file handling.

2. `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`:
- This method is run when execution flow exits the block of the with statement.
- It can handle exceptions, suppress them, or let them propagate.
- It's typically used to release the resource or rollback changes in case of errors.



```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print('Entering context')
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print('Exiting context')

with MyContextManager() as cm:
    print('Inside context')
```

    Entering context
    Inside context
    Exiting context


Here, the `open()` function returns a file object, and its `__enter__` method is called, which essentially does nothing special in this case. When the block inside the with statement is exited, the `__exit__` method of the file object is called, which closes the file. This ensures that the file is closed even if an exception occurs inside the block.


```python
# Without context manager
file = open("examples/sample.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print("without:", content)
file.close()

# With context manager
with open("examples/sample copy.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("with:", content)
```

    without: Hello, World!
    with: Hello, copy World!


With this context manager, you can ensure that database transactions are either committed if everything goes well or rolled back if an exception occurs.


```python
class DatabaseTransaction:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.connection = db_connection

    def __enter__(self):
        # Begin the transaction
        self.connection.begin()
        return self.connection

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is not None:
            # If an exception occurred, rollback the transaction
            self.connection.rollback()
        else:
            # Otherwise, commit the changes
            self.connection.commit()
```

#### contextlib <a id="contextlib"></a>

The `contextlib` module in Python's standard library provides utilities to work with context management more easily. While you can always create context managers using classes (by defining `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods), contextlib offers shortcuts and additional utilities.

Here are some of the main features of the contextlib module:

- `contextmanager` decorator: This decorator turns a generator into a context manager, allowing you to create a context manager using a function instead of a class.

- `closing` function: This function creates a context manager that closes the specified object when the context manager is exited.

- `suppress(*exceptions)`: Returns a context manager that suppresses any of the specified exceptions if they occur in the body of a with statement.

- `redirect_stdout` and `redirect_stderr` functions: These functions create context managers that redirect stdout and stderr to the specified file-like objects.

- `ExitStack` class: This class allows you to combine multiple context managers into a single context manager.

These are just a few of the utilities provided by the contextlib module. They simplify the creation and use of context managers, making resource management in Python more flexible and readable.


```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context_manager():
    print('Entering context')
    yield
    print('Exiting context')

with my_context_manager():
    print('Inside context')
```

    Entering context
    Inside context
    Exiting context


In this example, we define a context manager using the `@contextmanager` decorator and a generator function `my_context_manager()`. The `yield` statement is used to define the boundary between the `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods. The `print()` statements are used to indicate when the context is being entered and exited.

We use the `with` statement to create a context manager that automatically calls the `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods. We use the `my_context_manager()` function as a context manager by calling it with the `with` statement. We then print a message indicating that we are inside the context.


```python
from contextlib import closing
from urllib.request import urlopen

lines = []
with closing(urlopen('https://www.google.com')) as page:
    for line in page:
        lines.append(line)

print(len(lines))
```

    18



```python
import os
from contextlib import suppress

with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
    os.remove('somefile.tmp')
# This code will suppress a FileNotFoundError if the file doesn't exist.
```


```python
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import io

f = io.StringIO()
with redirect_stdout(f):
    print('This will be written to f instead of stdout')
print(f.getvalue())
```

    This will be written to f instead of stdout
    



```python
from contextlib import ExitStack

filenames = ['examples/sample.txt', 'examples/sample copy.txt']
with ExitStack() as stack:
    files = [stack.enter_context(open(fname)) for fname in filenames]
    # All files will be properly closed at the end of the with block
```
