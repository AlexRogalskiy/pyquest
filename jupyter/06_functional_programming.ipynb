    "**Functional Programming** is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions in a way that the output of a function is only dependent on its input arguments, without any side effects (i.e., changes to the state of the program outside the function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports functional programming by providing features such as *first-class functions* (functions can be passed around and used as arguments), *higher-order functions* (functions that can take functions as arguments and return functions), *lambda functions* (anonymous functions), and built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for operating on collections. Python also includes `list`, `dictionary`, and `set` comprehensions for creating new collections based on existing ones in a concise and readable way, as well as decorators for enhancing the behavior of functions and methods without permanently modifying their functionality.\n",
