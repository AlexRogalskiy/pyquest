    "\n",
    "Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a computer program. It is a crucial part of the software development process. The process of debugging involves identifying the bug, isolating the source of the bug, and then fixing the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Print Statements**: One of the simplest forms of debugging, where you insert print statements in your code to display values of variables at certain points during execution. This method is straightforward but can become cumbersome for large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code offer built-in debugging tools, including breakpoints, step-through execution, variable inspection, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**: Python's `logging` module allows you to log runtime information, which can be more flexible and less intrusive than print statements. Logs can be configured to show different levels of information (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical) and can be outputted to different destinations (console, file, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pdb (Python Debugger)**: The `pdb` module is Python's standard debugger and offers an interactive interface for debugging. You can set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. It's a powerful tool for more complex debugging tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Debuggers**: There are other Python debuggers available, such as `ipdb` (which integrates with the IPython environment for a more user-friendly interface) and remote debuggers provided by some IDEs for debugging code running in different environments."

    "#### Debugging Techniques <a id=\"debugging-techniques\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rubber Duck Debugging**: This technique involves explaining your code and the problem you're facing in detail to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck). Articulating the problem can often lead you to a solution more quickly because it forces you to slow down and think through the logic step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Divide and Conquer**: When faced with a complex problem, break down the code into smaller, manageable parts. Test these parts individually to isolate where the problem lies. This approach helps in narrowing down the exact location of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print Debugging**: Inserting print statements to show the flow of execution or the state of variables at various points in the program. While not sophisticated, it's a quick way to gain insights into how data is changing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Assertions**: Assertions are statements that check if a condition is true. They're used to catch bugs early by validating the state of a program. If an assertion fails, it means there's a flaw in the logic that needs to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Backtracking**: When you encounter an error, work backward from the point of failure to understand what led to the problem. This technique is especially useful for complex errors that don't have an obvious cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Change One Thing at a Time**: When debugging, it's tempting to make multiple changes to fix a problem. However, changing one thing at a time and then testing can help pinpoint exactly what fixes the issue, making it easier to understand the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use a Debugger**: Debuggers like `pdb` in Python allow you to execute code step by step, inspect variables, and understand the program's state at various execution points. This can be more efficient than print debugging for complex issues."

    "2. **Green**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This step focuses on functionality, not perfection.\n",
