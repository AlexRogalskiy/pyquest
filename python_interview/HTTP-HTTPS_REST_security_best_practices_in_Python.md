### Basic Knowledge of Networking and Security: HTTP/HTTPS, REST, Security Best Practices in Python

#### HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are protocols used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, over the internet.

##### Key Points

1. **HTTP**: An application-layer protocol designed for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
   
2. **HTTPS**: A secure version of HTTP, where communications are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This adds a layer of security that protects against eavesdropping and tampering.

3. **Usage**: HTTP is used for website access, API interactions, and more. HTTPS is preferred for any scenario where sensitive data, such as login credentials or personal information, is transmitted.

#### REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication model, and is used by many web services.

##### Key Principles

1. **Stateless**: Each HTTP request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request.
2. **Resource-Based**: Interactions are made over a network to retrieve or manage a resource, identified by URIs.
3. **Representation**: When a client requests a resource, it receives a representation of the resource, such as JSON or XML.

##### RESTful Web Services

- Web services that conform to REST principles are known as RESTful services. They allow for scalability, simplicity, and easy modification.

#### Security Best Practices in Python

Ensuring the security of applications is crucial. Some best practices in Python include:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs to prevent injections and other attacks.
2. **Use Secure and Updated Libraries**: Use libraries known for their security, and keep them updated.
3. **Manage Secrets Safely**: Use environment variables or secure vaults for storing secrets like API keys and passwords.
4. **HTTPS for Sensitive Data**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, especially if it's sensitive.
5. **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors so that they do not expose sensitive information or internal workings of the application.
6. **Access Control**: Implement strong access control to ensure that users can only access the data and actions they are permitted to.
7. **Security Headers**: In web applications, use security-related HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc., to mitigate risks like clickjacking and XSS attacks.
8. **Keep Python Updated**: Use the latest stable version of Python to benefit from security patches.

#### Conclusion

Understanding HTTP/HTTPS and REST is fundamental for web development and API interactions. Security in Python applications involves a range of best practices from input validation to using HTTPS and managing access control effectively. These practices are essential for building robust, secure Python applications and services.
