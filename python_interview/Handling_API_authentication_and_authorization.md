### Basic Understanding of Web Development: Handling API Authentication and Authorization

#### API Authentication and Authorization

In web development, authentication and authorization are critical for securing APIs. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or system, while authorization determines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do.

#### Authentication Methods

1. **Basic Authentication**: Involves sending a user name and password with each request, typically encoded using Base64. It is simple but not very secure unless used with HTTPS.
   
2. **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)**:
   - **OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication.
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Encoded tokens that store a set of claims and are used for authentication and information exchange.

3. **API Keys**: Unique identifiers used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.

4. **Session-Based Authentication**: Uses server-side sessions to maintain user state.

#### Authorization Techniques

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access decisions are based on the roles that users have within the system.
2. **Permissions and Scopes**: Define what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform or what resources they can access.

#### Implementing Authentication and Authorization

- **Secure Transmission**: Always use HTTPS to transmit sensitive information like authentication tokens and API keys.
- **Password Storage**: Never store plain-text passwords. Use hashing algorithms (like bcrypt) for storing passwords.
- **Token Validation**: Validate authentication tokens on the server for each request.
- **Session Management**: For session-based authentication, manage session lifetimes and have mechanisms for session invalidation.

#### Example: Token-Based Authentication with JWT in a Flask API

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import jwt

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    # Validate user here
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({'user_id': user_id}, 'secret', algorithm='HS256')
    return jsonify(token=encoded_jwt)

@app.route('/protected', methods=['GET'])
def protected():
    token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    try:
        jwt.decode(token, 'secret', algorithms=['HS256'])
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return jsonify(error='Invalid token'), 401
    # Proceed if valid
    return jsonify(data='Protected data')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

#### Conclusion

Handling API authentication and authorization is crucial for ensuring that only legitimate users can access certain functionalities or data in web applications. The choice of the authentication method and the authorization technique depends on the specific requirements of the application. Security best practices, such as using HTTPS, hashing passwords, and validating tokens, are essential for protecting sensitive information.
