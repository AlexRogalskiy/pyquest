### Advanced Python Concepts: Iterators and Generators

#### Iterators

An iterator in Python is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all its values. Typically, an iterator is implemented with methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.

##### Key Concepts

- **`__iter__` Method**: Returns the iterator object itself and is used in `for` and `in` statements.
- **`__next__` Method**: Returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more items, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.

##### Example

```python
class Count:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.current = low
        self.high = high

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current > self.high:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1

# Using the iterator
for number in Count(1, 3):
    print(number)  # Outputs: 1 2 3
```

#### Generators

Generators are a simpler way to create iterators using functions and the `yield` statement. A generator function is defined like a normal function but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the `yield` keyword rather than `return`.

##### Key Concepts

- **`yield` Statement**: When the generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a generator. The function execution stops at the `yield` statement and resumes when the next value is requested.
- **State Preservation**: Unlike regular functions, the local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators produce items one at a time and only when required, leading to increased efficiency, especially when working with large datasets.

##### Example

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Using the generator
for number in countdown(3):
    print(number)  # Outputs: 3 2 1
```

#### Conclusion

Iterators and generators are powerful concepts in Python, providing an efficient way to iterate over data. While iterators require a class with `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, generators achieve the same with less code. Generators are especially useful for working with large data sets, as they provide data one item at a time and only as needed, thus conserving memory.
